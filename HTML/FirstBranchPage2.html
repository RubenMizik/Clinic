        <h2> How It Works</h2>
        <p>You will submit a Health Declaration Form for us to check and prepare immediately for your health status. Next, you will head to the Clinic Facility on the Ground Floor in Room 101, where your health status will be checked by our nurses and doctors, and you will receive treatment if needed. If you have any questions, you can contact us through the Contacts page. If you find any bugs or problems, you can send a report through the Help page.</p>

        <p>This platform is incredibly helpful because it streamlines health declarations, reduces wait times at the clinic, and ensures prompt medical attention. By monitoring health proactively, it helps prevent the spread of illnesses, keeps the campus safe, and provides peace of mind for everyone involved. It's a vital tool for maintaining a healthy learning and working environment.</p>
